Made code modular to extent
1.Perform 40 epochs without L1 and L2
2.Perform 40 epochs with L1 
3.Perform 40 epochs with L2
4.Perform 40 epochs without L1 and L2
For each of the above scenario
1. Identify misclassifed 
2. Plot graph with training accuracy, test accuracy, train loss and test loss
Create graph that compares all the above scenarios.
